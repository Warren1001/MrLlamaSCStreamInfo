# General Information about MrLlamaSC's Diablo Clone Walk Events

SOJ = Stone of Jordan

## What is the IP?

The IP will never be announced. You do not need to know the IP if you are looking for SOJs sold. Not sharing the IP gives everyone in chat a fair chance to randomly get in. Please do not ask for the IP or accuse Llama of being a scammer because he did not give you the IP for free.

## How Diablo Clone Works

Diablo Clone works by selling 75-125 SOJs to one particular server. Each region consists of many game servers, all of which have their own SOJ sold counter. For Diablo Clone to be able to spawn in a game, the game must be made in Hell difficulty on the server that the SOJs are being sold in. The entire IP (all four octets) has to match for it to be considered the same server. As SOJs are sold, every game on that server (even Normal games, but Diablo Clone will only spawn in Hell games) will see "x SOJs sold" in the chat box. Once the SOJs sold reach the randomly chosen number between 75 and 125, Diablo Clone spawns in every game on that server and the SOJ sold number is reset and randomly chosen between 75 and 125 again. Once Diablo Clone walks, he will spawn at the next superunique monster you encounter. There are no other requirements.

## How Does Llama Run His Events?

At the time of writing, Llama has been asking PapaChrisTV to organize the event by collecting all the SOJs. Members from PapaChrisTV's community and Llama's community contribute 3 SOJs for guaranteed access to a game on the server that the SOJs will be sold in. This is usually arranged days ahead in time, so watch for announcements from either PapaChris or Llama about upcoming walk events. Once the day arrives to start the event, PapaChris and his community choose an isolated server IP and begin finding games on that IP and allowing those that bought in to the event to join the game. All SOJs collected from the participating members are given to Llama where he sells them slowly on stream. He sells them slowly so that those that are watching that did not buy in have a chance of randomly joining games and finding the server by seeing the "x SOJs sold" message in the game's chat.

## If I am not participating, how do I get a chance to join the server?

At the time of writing, Llama and PapaChris have been running the event on Asia region. The full IP will ***NEVER*** be announced. You will need to load your game onto the proper region (Click the Globe icon above the Play button on the Battle.net Launcher and choose the correct region) and begin making games in ***HELL DIFFICULTY***. You will be able to see the "x SOJs sold" message in Normal games, but Diablo Clone will NOT spawn in a Normal game. Then wait for Llama to sell an SOJ on stream (sometimes PapaChris sells them instead, make sure to keep up to date on stream). Once you see him sell one, look at the chat in your game. If you see the "x SOJs sold" message, you are in the right game! Now you just have to be patient. If you do not see the message, you will have to create a new game. The message will appear INSTANTLY after Llama sells the SOJ. The Twitch Stream will be delayed, so you will see the "x SOJs sold" message a few seconds before he actually sells it on stream. You will have to keep trying until you see this message. It is an EXTREMELY low chance for you to get in the right server, so please keep that in mind before raging at Llama or chat that you cannot find the game. Please do not rage at Llama or chat, you are not entitled to a game since you did not spend anything to get in.

## Llama keeps saying "subnet" / How to Block IPs

There are third party tools you can use to process-eliminate and make it easier to join the correct server. [Here is Llama's guide on how to see the server IP of the game that you are currently in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbJOIMM5Ino). This is not particularly useful if Llama has not given the full IP out. However, you are able to use Windows firewall (or other connection-blocking methods) to prevent you from connecting to certain regions and only connect to the subnet that the game is on. This will eliminate roughly 75% of possible games you can get in, but the amount of servers still available is very large still, so the chances are still extremely low. [Here is a guide from the Diablo Clone Hunters community on how to block certain IPs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/898254702779695174/901804081864130581/Diablo_Clone_Hunters_Guide.pdf) (you'll have to scroll down a bit on the PDF). If Llama says the subnet is "34", then you want to block all other subnets (35, 104, and 158). More information about this can be found on the Diablo Clone Hunters guide.

## "Llama is a duper/scammer"

Join the next walk event and you can see that none of the SOJs were duped or RMT'd, nor has he scammed. If you are unwilling to prove your claims of Llama duping/RMT/scamming, then you're full of crap.
