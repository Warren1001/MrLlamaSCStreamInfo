***Mods?***
- Mods aren't possible with the remake version, but the original "legacy" version still supports mods.

***Hacks/bots/RMT/3rd party?***
- Uses the new Battlenet system which is more secure, but hacks still exist. Official RMT was not touched upon, so none by Blizzard.

- Yes, exists as normal.

- One global realm.

***Characters expire?***

***Consoles?***
- Yup. With cross-progress, meaning progress on your Switch carries over to your PC and to your Playstation and so forth and so forth.

***Two skills buttons for PC?***
- Yup. Console has button pressing for 5 skills though, so maybe option for button casting or more than 2 on PC?
