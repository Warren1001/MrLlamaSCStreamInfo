# Guide to Contribute

###### Note: edits to this file will not be accepted.

<br>

If you would like to contribute to any of the above pages or make your own page, you are welcome to! Do know that any changes, tips, tricks, or guides presented will have to be confirmed by me (Warren1001).

To get started, you can either:
	- Visit the page you would like to modify and press the edit button (![Edit](https://i.gyazo.com/e0befa85591c7151d9ea4a0f493c89ff.png)) which can be found at the top right and make your changes, OR
	- In the base of the repository (where you view this and can still see the other files), press `Add File` and press `Create New File`.
		- If neither of these options are available, you need to verify your e-mail to your account. If you do not have an account, you need one.

What this will do is it will create a clone of this repository under your account. You are free to edit it how you please.
What actually happens by clicking these two buttons is it creates a clone of the repository, and then in that repository a new branch is made called 'patch-#'. This branch will contain whatever changes you made after you create a new file or edit an existing file. Once you're done making modifications, you can add some information in the `Propose changes` or `Propose new file` title and detail boxes, and then click `Propose changes` or `Propose new file`.

This will take you to a new page where you will be comparing what already exists in my repository with what you have modified in your cloned repository. You'll essentially do the same thing again and add any relevant information and then press `Create pull request`. It is recommended you leave `Allow edits by maintainers` checkmarked so that I can correct any grammatical errors, formatting issues, incorrect information, or anything else. Then you can review the changes I made to the changes you made, give me your OK and then I'll finalize the changes and add them officially to the repository.

There is more you can do with the tools on this website, however I will not make a guide for them. You can test and browse yourself, or Google various things about GitHub. You can edit your own changes again, even if you have already submitted a PR (Pull Request). Just find your edits and in the 3 dots at the top right of the viewer of your commits, there should be an edit button.

## Requirements for your additions to be finalized

1. It needs to have readable and understandable grammar.
2. Any executable files that are directly linked in your guide will need to be proven they are not viruses.
3. Be sure the name of the page ends in `.md`. You can see that all the pages end in `.md`, which is the extension for Markdown. Markdown is a formatting language. You can view information about how to format your guide to look nicely with Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
	1. With this being mentioned, your guide or edits must look presentable and make use of formatting wherever possible for the guide to be readable.
	2. Preference should be given to following the same style that is already used for these guides. You can edit these files to see how they are formatted.
4. It must be accurate. If you write a guide on how to Bug Andy and you say that you have to go through the town portal that Andariel spawns, your changes will not be finalized because that simply is not true.
5. It must follow the rules of Llama's stream.
6. Guides must be in English - with one exception. If the guide is already present, you are allowed to make another guide in another language which is simply a translation. If you create a guide that is not already here that is not in English, you will need to provide an English version as well.
