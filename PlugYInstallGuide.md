# How to install PlugY for Diablo 2 version 1.13d


#### Because this is for an outdated version of Diablo 2, if you also want to play Battle.net, you will need two separate installations.

#### Additionally, there has been a third-party update of PlugY for 1.14d (the current latest version of Diablo 2). However, it has neither stood the test of time nor was it reviewed by the original author of PlugY, Yohann. If you are still interested in using the updated version, you can find the guide [here](https://github.com/Warren1001/MrLlamaSCStreamInfo/blob/master/PlugY1.14InstallGuide.md).

#### Finally, there is [a video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czO1LYKytG8) you can use instead of text guide, but people have reported issues with some of the steps he has shown in the guide. It is also a little over-complicated.


1. **You will need to obtain a legacy online installer.**
	- The reason is because you cannot downgrade from 1.14, as it has undergone too many changes.
	1. *You can find links to the legacy online installer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofdiablo/comments/4b48oz/how_to_download_and_install_version_113/d160fdh/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/wiki/index/setup)*.

2. **Install Diablo 2 using the legacy online installer.**
	- In the event that loading up the installer says "Play Diablo 2" instead of "Install Diablo 2", you will have to rename your current Diablo 2 folder.
		- Find your current Diablo 2 folder and either delete it if you do not plan to use it at all or rename the folder to something else so that you can install Diablo 2 again. Then restart the installer and install as normal.
3. **Your Diablo 2 is now at 1.12a. However, we want to be at 1.13d, so we need to patch Diablo 2 to 1.13d.**
	1. To do this, we will download the standalone patch from Blizzard's website, which you can find [here](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_113d.exe).
	2. To ensure everything goes smoothly, go to your Diablo 2 folder and apply the following settings to both `Diablo II.exe` and `Game.exe`:
		1. Right click the executable and go to `Properties`.
		2. Go to the `Compatibility` tab.
		3. Check the box that says `Run this program in compatibility mode for:` and change the compatibility mode to `Windows XP (Service Pack 2)`.
		4. Check the box that says `Run this program as an administrator`.
		- Now these programs should work properly and not cause issues when we update using the standalone patch.
4. **Run the `LODPatch_113d.exe` program in administrator mode.**
	- This will update your Diablo 2. HOWEVER, Diablo 2 will try to start immediately. If it loads successfully, it will try to connect to Battle.net and get the latest patch. Obviously, we do not want this! *If Diablo 2 begins loading, spam `Esc` until it closes!*
	- Sometimes, Diablo 2 will not load properly, which is okay. If you suspect the Diablo 2 application hung, go to your Task Manager and force `Game.exe` to close. Or restart your computer.
5. **Now we are at the proper Diablo 2 version, so we can begin installing PlugY. You can obtain [PlugY v11.02 here](http://plugy.free.fr/PlugY_The_Survival_Kit_v11.02.zip).**
	- You can view the official PlugY site [here](http://plugy.free.fr/). We will be using the `Zip version` as the installer version tends to create more issues than it solves.
6. **Open the `PlugY_The_Survival_Kit_v11.02.zip` file.**
7. **Drag and all the files from this file into the Diablo 2 folder.**
	- We do not care about the any of the `.txt`, the `PatchD2File.exe`, or the `RestoreD2File.exe` files. You can get rid of them if you wish.
8. **Perform the settings we did in Step `3.ii` to `PlugY.exe` in your Diablo 2 folder.**
9. **Right click `PlugY.exe` and press `Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)`.**
10. **Go to your Desktop, right click the new shortcut, go to `Properties` and click on the `Shortcut` tab.**
11. **In the `Target:` box, add `-w` to the end.**
	- For most people, the `Target:` box should read `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\PlugY.exe" -w`.
		- The `"` on either side of the path are required to add `-w` to the end.
12. **Launch PlugY using the shortcut on your desktop.**

##### Enjoy! If you run into any issues (which is likely, as there are several things that can cause the PlugY installation to go astray), @mention or DM Warren1001 on [MrLlama's Discord](https://discord.gg/BePVw9e).
