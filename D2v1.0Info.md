# Diablo 2 v1.00 (the version the game released publicly as, without any additional patches) (7/31/20) (list in progress)


###### Note: If you have a Github account, you can submit a PR with any edits incase of any additional information or inaccuracies. Be sure you change the date to the current date of the edit (mm/dd/yy).

Since the topic seems to confuse people, LoD did not exist in 1.00. This is Classic, however Classic today and 1.00 are completely different. He is not playing LoD 1.00.
If you are wanting to play an old school version of Diablo 2, consider playing 1.06b instead of 1.00. 1.06b has nearly all of these differences but without as many game breaking bugs.
If you are wanting to play with bugs, then so be it. You can find a guide to play with 1.00 or 1.06b on [MrLlama's Discord](https://discord.gg/BePVw9e) in the `# mods` text channel.

- **Functionality**
  - You cannot shift click potions into the belt.
  - You cannot directly insert items into the cube by dropping it onto the cube if the item is larger than 2x2 in space.
  - Maximum resolution of 640x480.
  - It always minimizes on Windows 10 if you click outside the window in windowed mode.
  - Hardcore is not an option until you have completed Normal difficulty once on Softcore.
  - Insanely small stash. 6x4. 24 slots. Four times smaller than the current version.
  - The Cow Level DOES exist.
    - Killing the Cow King does **NOT** prevent you from making the portal again.
  - Weather has lightning and thunder. The thunder sound effect still exists for the Sorceress skill Thunderstorm. However, 1.00 has a bright flash where the entire screen flickers white once or twice.
    - Likely got removed to either seizure issues or the fact that people figured out how to force this effect onto others' screens permanently (called flashing, a very annoying hack, you had to hack yourself to avoid being permanently blinded with lightning flashes flickering on and off, or avoid the hacker).
  - Act 5, the Assassin, and the Druid do not exist.
  - Upon killing Diablo, the game forcibly ends in 2 minutes.
  - There is no /players command.
  - The Nightmare and Hell resistance penalties are -20, -50 respectively.
  - Dexterity does not affect block chance. Only the shield block chance (and Holy Shield) can modify block chance.
  - There are no leech penalities.
    - Undead monsters in Hell can be leeched at full effectiveness.
  - There are no respecs at all. No tokens and no Akara respecs.

- **Items**
  - No runes.
  - No charms.
  - No jewels.
  - No elite items.
  - Gems are weaker and can only drop up to normal tier. You have to cube for Flawless and Perfect (with the exception of the Hellforge).
  - No class-only items.
    - Necromancer heads, Sorceress orbs, Paladin shields, Barbarian helms, and so forth do not exist at all.
  - No unique exceptional items (only normal tier uniques).
  - Sockets appear differently visually. Instead of being placed in the center of the item, they are aligned with the grid that the item takes the place of, starting at the bottom left and filling upward.
  - Two-handed maces are bugged. All two-handed maces do their one-handed damage, which is 1-1 damage. Thus, mauls and such are useless.
  - Enhanced damage does not contribute to bow damage properly.
  - Failed uniques roll as a rare item with 5x durability.
  - Failed sets roll as a magic item with 3x durability.
  - Sell values of items are different, and depend on durability a lot. It is recommended to repair items before selling them, unless the repair cost + the sell value is less than the maximum sell value of that act.
  - The unique item tier is treated literally. If a unique item exists in the game on any character (stash, equipped, or inventory) or has previously dropped, it will not drop in that game. If you are using a Stone of Jordan, you will never find another.
  - However, taken the above note into account, there is a predetermined order for unique items with similar bases (rings or amulets). The order for unique rings will always be Manald -> Nagel -> SoJ. If you have a Manald and Nagel somewhere in your possession, your next unique ring will be a SoJ. If you have all three, the unique fails and rolls rare.
  - The odds to gamble sets and uniques are significantly greater.
    - 3% for Unique
    - 5% for Set
    - 7% for Rare
    - 85% for Magic
  - Gold is significantly harder to come by, as items do not sell for near as much.
  - Only normal rarity items can have sockets.

- **Affixes**
  - Charges of skills (tp staff) do not exist.
  - The rare affix pool is significantly smaller. This means good affixes like +stats and +res spawn much more often.
  - There are no 'Magic only' affixes, so a rare item can always be better than a magic item.
    - The same generally applies to the affixes Set items have.
  - Speed stats for animations like IAS and FCR do not use specific numbers, but variations of "Faster Speed".
    - The amount of speed differences vary between the animation that is being sped up.

- **Skills**
  - There are no cooldowns for skills.
  - There are no synergies for skills.
  - *Barbarian*
    - Whirlwind at its most broken state. It hits a whopping *25 times per second*. This makes IAS not needed. The ideal weapon is a failed Unique (becomes Rare with 5x durability) Pike with high damage. Combined with adequate life and mana steal, the Barbarian can achieve near-immortality while dishing out insane damage. The downside is these weapons break at an insane pace.
    - Leap Attack is considered a spell. It cannot miss and it does not suffer penalties from reflect damage, such as being cursed with Iron Maiden.
    - Due to the lack of synergies, passive buff shouts have very little duration. Battle Orders is the only shout worth more than 1 point. It also has massive diminishing returns from skill points, so it should be lower priority to max.
  - *Sorceress*
    - Warmth is actually useful. Nothing is different, but without synergies, you have nowhere else to put your skills. Without mana potions, you need every bit of mana you can get.
    - Frozen Orb is powerful with no cooldowns, however its spell works differently. With NoHit also being different as well as synergies not existing to boost damage, to gain maximum damage potential from Frozen Orb, you have to aim it to where the orb explodes directly on your target for you to have decent damage. Frozen Orb also tanks your mana. It is expected to have max Warmth and utilize Energy Shield with stat points in Energy to effectively use Frozen Orb. Blizzard is also decent, but doesn't compare to Frozen Orb.
    - Fire Wall also benefits from having no cooldown and has decent damage in this patch. I do not fully comprehend Fire Wall, but the general gist of it is that the damage applied is continuously while in it. It may reach 1fpa like Whirlwind does. However, the damage stated on the skill tooltip is divided by the amount of times it hits in a second, unlike Whirlwind. Still a good skill in this version, since you can stack Fire Walls ontop of each other at a quick rate.
    - Lightning Mastery reduces the mana cost of lightning spells.
    - Charged Bolt does poor damage.
    - Static Field does not have a penalty in Nightmare or Hell.
    - AoE skills like Frozen Orb, Frozen Nova, and Nova are better in this patch as a result of monsters not having as much health.
  - *Necromancer*
    - Skelebros aren't great.
      - They do less damage.
      - The AI sucks.
      - If you get too far from your skeletons, they die. They will not teleport to you if they get stuck.
      - Supposedly, getting some skills into Skeleton Mastery helps, but the build overall is not that strong.
    - Corpse Explosion is significantly more powerful. It scales with players in the game and it gains a yard of area of effect for every hard point.
      - *A maxed Corpse Explosion can kill monsters off screen*.
    - A bug exists with Blood Golem where reflect damage counts as the damage that the golem does, which heals you and him.
      - Using Blood Golem and casting Iron Maiden of those who attack it will grant near-immortality to you and your Blood Golem.
  - *Amazon*
    - Overall sucks.
    - With the bug of ED% not affecting bows, physical damage bow skills suck, as you are stuck on the base damage the bow does.
      - However, *Guided Arrow pierces nearly infinitely*.
    - Javelin skills and Elemental Bow skills are not as powerful without the synergies, and are generally a worse version of the Sorceress, since you do not have access to Warmth and do less damage and mana steal will not scale well with no ED%.
    - Spear skills suck the same they do in the current version.
  - **Paladin**
    - The Hammerdin build is alright, but not near as powerful as it is in the current version since there are no synergies.
    - Zeal suffers the zeal bug. If a swing misses, every subsequent swing also misses.
    - The offensive auras do not grant additional damage to weapons. They only do their AoE damage.
    - Conversion + Thorns is a popular build, as the monster stats in this version makes Thorns decent.

- **NPCs**
  - Vendors do NOT sell mana potions. *This makes all caster builds inferior to melee builds*!
  - Vendors have a limited supply of all items. An NPC inventory may have 10 individual health potions. This means you can only buy these 10 health potions.
  - 'Repair All' button does not exist. You have to manually repair each item.
  - Atma does not heal you.
  - Natalya does not exist.
  - Mercenaries suck.
    - They cannot wear gear.
    - They cannot be taken between acts.
    - They cannot be resurrected.
    - You cannot pass through your mercenary.
    - The Act 2 mercenary has slightly different animations for moving around. They also wear a helmet.
    - The skills and benefits of a mercenary vary. In the current version, every mercenary has an ability. In 1.00, they can have zero skills and the skill selection is different.
    - They are generally weaker compared to the current version because their AI is less aggressive.

- **Monsters**
  - They have less life.
  - Do not have any immunities. Instead, they can have insanely high resistances (but not greater than or equal to 100).
  - All monsters have four times the intended amount of attack rating.
    - This makes defense useless. Casters do not want to get hit. Melee builds build around leeching.
  - Monsters give significantly less experience.
    - Leveling in 1.00 is slow. You are expected to finish Hell at around level 35.
    - Minions of unique monsters do not give bonus experience. Only the unique monster does.
  - MF only works on normal monsters. Not bosses, superuniques, uniques, or champions.
    - Additionally, Act bosses (with the exception of quest kill) have terrible drops outside of their quest kill. They are not worth farming at all.
      - However, the Cow King has insanely good drops and is one of the best places to farm, if not the best.
  - You cannot break hostility with a monster except for changing areas through load screens. This means every monster will chase you to the ends of the earth once they have seen you until they cannot physically follow you anymore.
  - Superunique monsters do not have pre-defined coloring. They can be any color. Green Rakanishu!
  - Superunique revivors are capable of reviving their same monster type. Meaning Bishibosh can resurrect Fallen Shamans. This might only apply to their minions.
  - The current version of D2 have a bug where some colors for unique monsters are not chosen. More colors are available for unique monsters. Purple monsters!
  - Flamespike the Crawler exists. He is the first run killer. He spawns on the Inner Cloister waypoint and is always Fire Enchanted Cursed.
  - Andariel spawns closer to the door in Level 4. If you walk through the large double door, her aggression is drawn immediately.
  - The Summoner is the second run killer, due to Fire Wall being powerful and the Summoner having a high level Fire Wall. If Summoner casts a Fire Wall on you, you will be killed nearly instantly.
  - The little Flayer dudes have a sound effect that is not present in the current version.
  - Monster packs with ranged skills will all follow the same AI when first encountering the player.
    - This means monsters like Heirophants and Blood Lords will all cast Blizzard or Meteor respectively at the same time. You will see 3-4 Blizzards stacked on top of each other casted directly on to you.
  - Unique monsters with the 'Teleportation' enchant will teleport often at low health. Each time they teleport, they gain health.
  - MSLE bug exists. To my understanding, hitting a monster with Multishot and Lightning Enchanted caused the lightning bolts released to be multishotted, tripling the amount of bolts normally spawned.
  - Maggot Young give experience and drop items.
    - Coupled with infinite AI range, not killing any of the Maggot Parents will cause nonstop spawns of Maggot Young, which can make infinite (and optimal) farming of experience, especially in the River of Flame.
  - Lord de Seis has the attribute 'Thief'.
    - Thief forcibly drops potions from your belt. It is known to be buggy and crash the game.
      - It is understood that Thief once allowed Seis to forcibly drop equipped items. This may have been apart of a Beta version, as 1.00 does not have this.
  - Lord de Seis spawns with an Oblivion Knight pack (the mages) instead of a Doom Knight pack (the meleers).
  - Oblivion Knights can cast Iron Maiden. *Yes, the Chaos Sanctuary has Iron Maiden, the ultimate Barbarian slayer*.
