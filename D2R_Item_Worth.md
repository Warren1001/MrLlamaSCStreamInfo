# A Comprehensive Valuable Item Guide (But Not an Item's Actual Value)

#### This overview contains NO direct values to items. Values of items in Diablo II are changing constantly, linearly, non-linearly, sometimes the value of an item goes down and then back up higher than what it was before then to go back down again, and so forth. This is meant as a guideline to what valuable items are, but NOT their specific value. Everything mentioned will be in relative terms. This is to help you as a player unfamiliar with the market to keep up with the rapid changes and get a good estimate for item values on your own intuition.
