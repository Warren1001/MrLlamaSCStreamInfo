# A Comprehensive Valuable Item Guide (But Not an Item's Actual Value)

#### This overview contains NO direct values to items. Values of items in Diablo II are changing constantly - linearly, non-linearly, sometimes the value of an item goes down and then back up higher than what it was before then to go back down again, and so forth. This overview is meant as a guideline to what valuable items are, but NOT their specific value. Everything mentioned will be in relative terms. This is to help you as a player unfamiliar with the market to keep up with the rapid changes and get a good estimate for item values on your own intuition.

## General

Modifiers that tend to make items useful FOR CASTERS are: +Skills, FCR, -% Enemy Resistance, +% (Cold/Fire/Lightning) Damage, +Resistances (including Damage Reduced by % (Physical Resistance)), +Stats (Strength, Life, Mana, Vitality, Energy), FHR, FRW, and Magic Find.
  - Casters are any build which does not require a weapon to do damage. This includes Trap Assassins.
    - Trap Assassins also find IAS valuable. They do not find -% Enemy Resistance and +% Lightning/Fire Damage valuable.
  - Please note: Defense in general is neither useful nor valuable to casters.
Modifiers that tend to make items useful FOR MELEE are: +Damage, +% Enhanced Damage, IAS, +Maximum and Minimum Damage, + Attack Rating, Life Steal, Deadly Strike, Crushing Blow, Open Wounds, +Resistances (including Damage Reduced by % (Physical Resistance)), +Stats (Strength, Dexterity, Life, Vitality), Mana Steal, FHR, +Skills, FRW, and Magic Find.
  - Melee builds are any build, including ranged builds, that do weapon damage.
    - A Tornado Druid does not need a weapon to cast his tornadoes, so he does not do weapon damage.
    - Vengeance Paladins and Elemental Zealers (Tesladin, Auradins), while doing elemental damage, is a weapon damage skill, so it is a melee build.
      - Vengeance Paladins find -% Enemy Resistance, +% (Cold/Fire/Lightning) Damage useful.

### How to Gauge Substantial Modifiers

For random items like magic, rare, and crafts - but also applicable to all items - a useful modifier is only valuable if it's substantial. A modifier is substantial if the numerical roll (example: Raven Frost's Dexterity modifier has a numerical roll of 15-20) of the modifier is at least half of the total numerical average of that modifier for all useful items (example: Sorceress weapon slot has Spirit, Heart of the Oak, The Oculus, Eschuta's Temper, and Death's Fathom as useful items which all have ~20-40% FCR, making that the approximate total numerical average of FCR for a Sorceress weapon) for that item slot (item slot being weapon, helmet, shield, charm, etc). To know if the numerical roll of a modifier is at least half of the total average, consider popular items for that slot.

Take a Spirit sword (weapon slot) for a caster as an example. It is extremely cheap and extremely common, so it serves as a good basis for numerical averages. For useful modifiers, Spirit has +2 All Skills, 35% FCR, 55% FHR, +40~ to Vitality, +100~ to Mana, and \~30% to Cold/Lightning/Poison Resistance. Let's say you find a Sorceress Orb with the following modifiers: +2 to Lightning Skills, 20% FCR, Adds 1-117 Lightning Damage, +3 to Lightning, +37 to Mana, 29% to Poison Resistance, and 1 socket. Is your item valuable? Let's consider its useful modifiers: +2 to Lightning Skills, 20% FCR, +3 to Lightning, +37 to Mana, 29% to Poison Resistance, and 1 socket. Let's take away, numerically, modifiers that both items have so that we see modifiers unique to each item. Spirit has: +2 to Cold Skills, +2 to Fire Skills, +2 to Oskills (+All Skills is the most valuable +Skill stat), 15% FCR, 55% FHR, +40~ to Vitality, +60~ to Mana, and ~30% to Cold/Lightning. The Sorceress Orb has: +3 to Lightning and 1 socket. It's clear to see which one is better. Now that we have established that the Sorceress Orb is inferior to Spirit, what value does it have? Remember that Spirit weapon is extremely cheap - it consists of 4 low runes and a weapon base typically found in Normal. With how much more useful Spirit is while still being extremely cheap, this makes the Sorceress Orb practically worthless.

You won't always know all common items for all item slots, especially for flexible builds, and even more so for builds that are unique or off-meta. Understanding what items are common is something you learn from simply playing the game. Learn from build guides, take note of what items people like to trade for (especially the people that are knowledgeable about the game), and learn the numerical ranges for modifiers for items to get a basic understanding of substantial modifiers.

## Runewords

Runewords are straightforward. The value of a runeword is typically the roll of the runeword plus the value of the base. An average runeword roll is almost always equal to the value of the runes + the value of the base. If the runeword rolled poorly, it will be worth less than the runes used to make it. This can be as low as half the rune value used to make the runeword depending upon how much variation the runeword can have and how high the supply is for the runeword. This can be seen to extreme proportions with the Spirit runeword. If the FCR roll of Spirit is less than 35% (perfect FCR roll), it is often completely worthless, even if the base (such as Monarch) still has value, because of how high the supply is for Spirit. In these cases, for the base to get its value back, the runeword should be unsocketed. If the value of the runes is worth more than the base, then you'll just have to value that item very cheaply. For runeword rolls higher than average, the value of the item increases expontentially as it gets closer to perfect. There is no standardized scale for this and this is something you as the user will have to figure out every time on your own (even I have to do this every time).
