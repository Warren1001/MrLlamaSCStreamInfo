### **Gear Wheel**
- `Drop X Item` Forces Llama to drop the equipped item.
	- If Llama has more than one of that item equipped, he chooses which one he wants to drop.
	- If Llama does not have that item that is allowed to be dropped, the wheel gets rerolled.
	- Llama is not allowed to sell the item for gold.
- `Drop Item Chat Choice` Forces Llama to drop an equipped item of chat's choice.
	- Dropping the Shame Cap is not allowed.
	- Dropping weapons is not allowed on the Barbarian.
	- Llama is not allowed to sell the item for gold.
- `Gamble/Replace X Item` Forces Llama to gamble the new item and wear the item if allowed. If Llama already has that item slot filled with an item, Llama is forced to get rid of it.
	- Llama is allowed to sell the item for gold.
- `Drop 1/2 Charms` Forces Llama to drop half of his charms.
	- If Llama only has one charm, he drops it.
	- If Llama has no charms, the wheel gets rerolled.
	- Llama is not allowed to sell charms for gold.

### **Llama Wheel**
- All options in this category stack with each other. A hand cam exists to prove Llama is doing these punishments.
- `Tiny Hand w/ Mitt` Llama has to use a tiny hand in his keyboard hand for X minutes.
- `Oven Mitts` Llama has to use an oven mitt on his mouse hand for X minutes.
- `Swap Hands` Llama has to control his keyboard with his right hand and his mouse with his left hand for X minutes.
- `Ski Goggles` Llama has to wear Ski Goggles for X minutes.
- `Turn Keyboard` Llama has to rotate his keyboard 180 degrees for X minutes.
- `Turn Mouse` Llama has to rotate his mouse 180 degrees for X minutes.
- `Half Mouse Speed` Llama reduces the speed that his mouse moves on screen by half for X minutes.
- `Clap Hands` Llama has to clap his hands every two seconds.
- `Blind Sketch` Llama has to sketch a random topic presented while his eyes are covered by the Shame Cap/Llama Hat.
	- This option is usually put on hold until a break and he does them all at once.
- `Bullet Chess` Llama has to play Bullet Chess until he wins 1 game.
	- This option is usually put on hold until a break and he does several at a time.

### **Game Wheel**
- `No Running` Llama is not allowed to run for X minutes.
- `No Minimap` Llama is not allowed to use the minimap for X minutes.
- `Next Stats Chat Choice` Chat gets to decide on Llama's next 5 stat points.
- `Next Skill Chat Choice` Chat gets to decide on Llama's next skill point.
- `No Health Potions` Llama is not allowed to use health potions for X minutes.
- `Grid Cursor` An overlay of a grid of cursors which follow the real cursor around for X minutes.
- `Big Cursor` An overlay of the original cursor made much bigger for X minutes.
- `DING!` Typing 'DING' in chat plays a noise on stream for X minutes. 15 second cooldown per person. Currently, evo_Demon has control over which sound is played. It defaults to the generic Windows error sound. The Secret Cow Level Cows' moos, a device being plugged in and unplugged into the PC, and OOF are options. There may be more.
	- This idea originated from the first Diablo 2 1.0 stream, where an application made by evo_Demon to make Diablo 2 not so buggy was glitching out, playing a Windows error noise every time Llama pressed a button on his keyboard under certain circumstances.
- `Players 2` Llama has to play the game with /players 2 setting for X minutes.
- `Last Roll Again` The wheel option of any wheel that was rolled just before this option is chosen again.

### **Evo Wheel**
- The crazy overlay options. Most options do not stack with each other.
- All overlays and chat interactions of MvS are made by evo_Demon.
- `Slightly Intoxicated Boat Guy` Diablo 2 screen rotates and sways side to side like a boat would on the ocean with [this music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UX25HFxCoc) in the background.
	- This one is 'slightly' because the [old version](https://youtu.be/lJy1uN0nr1w?t=480) was insane and a lot of people complained. It gets worse.
		- As of Season 7, the original version is in the Gamble Wheel.
- *Dog Songs*
	- These three songs usually accompany each other. The songs are accompanied by random images or gifs of dogs overlaying Diablo 2.
	- `Gabe-acito` Dog barking remix of Despacito by Luis Fonsi. By the famous Gabe the dog (RIP). [Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLrsR_0yerI).
	- `Thundawg` Dog barking remix of Thunder by Imagine Dragons, Gabe included. [Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kb_b3uC87k).
	- `RaDoggoActive` Dog barking remix of Radioactive by Imagine Dragons, Gabe included. [Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx4PpeP9XrQ).
- `Epic Llama` A bunch of mrllamaArmy emotes chase Llama's Diablo 2 cursor. If the Llamas get to the cursor, they start growing in size. As the overlay progresses, more mrllamaArmy emotes spawn and they get faster. The background song is [Grieg - In the Hall of the Mountain King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLp_Hh6DKWc).
- `D2 Rap (Aww Jeez)` A [Diablo 2 rap made by JeeZLawayZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uwr1Uplmv0) for Llama.
- `Enhance` The entire Diablo 2 window becomes blurry except for a box around his cursor which is still clear. Videos of crime shows where they are looking at images or videos asking the tech guy to "enhance the image" are overlayed on the window.
- `Diablo 1` Tristram music plays during the overlay while the main UI bar is redesigned to look like Diablo 1's main UI bar. A massive image blocks Llama's view if he is running ingame during this overlay, as you can only walk in Diablo 1. The image disappears when Llama starts walking.
- `DVD Screensaver` The Diablo 2 window bounces around like a DVD Screensaver. The speed of the window progressively gets faster. Perfect corners are possible.
- `Flip Screen` Flips the screen on the vertical axis. Crazier than it seems.
- `Defend Timmy (Run, Timmy, Run!)` Llama's cursor is Timmy and a bunch of passive-aggressive or angry Llamas are floating around, which Timmy has to dodge. If Timmy gets hit, an OOF noise plays. If Timmy gets hit by Llama too many times, Slap Chop is given as punishment.
- `Adopt Timmy` Llama's cursor is Timmy and Timmy and Llama are next to a busy highway in which trash is thrown from the vehicles and overlay his screen. Timmy has to pickup the trash to clear it from the screen. Occasionally, garbage trucks crash and unleash a ton of garbage.
- `Janet (Backseat Gamer)` An overlay of a video of a lady dubbed Janet using a Mac, who starts off playing Diablo 2 (which is actually Llama's Diablo 2 window). It eventually progresses to Janet watching Llama stream Diablo 2, which the Diablo 2 window on the stream is Llama's actual Diablo 2 window. Then it starts to becoming inceptual and we see Janet looking at a stream of Janet looking at a stream of Llama playing Diablo 2. This Diablo 2 window is where Llama's real Diablo 2 window is. Other funny image/gif placements exist, such as *X for Dummies - by Y* book images and [Llama's firesuit dance video](https://clips.twitch.tv/TenuousSoftOysterSaltBae).
- `Diablo Immortal (Diablo Immobile)` An overlay of someone playing a game on a phone where a finger swipes back and forth, but Llama's Diablo 2 window is on the phone screen.
- `Sham Wow` Clips taken from a long Sham Wow commercial presented by Vince. Between every video segment, Llama's cursor is replaced with a Sham Wow which erases the pixels on screen by drawing white pixels over the Diablo 2 window where the cursor has been. Toward the end, when the special offer is presented for 8 Sham Wows, Llama's cursor is replaced with 8 Sham Wows that erase the pixels on screen.
- `Half Screen` Random boxes are placed on Llama's Diablo 2 window to block half of his screen.
- `Buzzwords` A robot speaking random English words that somehow forms grammatically correct sentences.

### **Gamble Wheel**
- This wheel contains every option possible. Every. Option. Including helps. Does not include retired options. Includes Original Boat Guy.

### **Separate Options**
- `Slap Chop` Clips taken from the long Slap Chop commercial presented by Vince. Every time Vince uses the Slap Chop in the video, Llama's Diablo 2 is chopped. A chop is when the screen is cut in half horizontally and vertically in four even corners and then the corners are randomized. It is possible for the four corners to randomize to their original spots.
- `Dim Vision (Dimmestest Vision)` The jumpscare overlay. The screen darkens dramatically with eerie music in the background as long with various jump scares and creepy noises. Some of the jump scares are extremely, EXTREMELY loud. Some of the visual jump scares are not epilepsy-safe. This overlay has a special countdown in which the countdown does not update so that Llama does not know when it ends. There can be jump scares after the screen lightens back up.
		- It's called Dimmestest Vision because it has gone through several iterations, overhauls, and additions.
- `Not My Type!` A donator (or someone the donator specifies) gets limited control of Llama's Diablo 2 screen. This is limited to whatever is possible through key and mouse presses. The options vary between dropping items (limited to 5 drops), to casting town portals with the animation (limited to 20 town portals), to opening menus, to drinking potions. Some options unlisted. Using 'tp' in the Arreat Summit (at Ancients) is not allowed. The command 'barrelroll' forces Llama's cursor to the four corners of the screen. It is possible to use various combinations of options to get Llama to accidentally save and quit, such as opening a menu and then closing it at the same time Llama closes it with 'Esc', so that Llama instead opens the Escape menu and accidentally clicks on Save and Quit.
- `Dodgeball` This starts a momentary period of collecting 1 dollar donations, which add to a game of dodgeball. Upon commencement of the game, a bunch of chat-controlled images appear on screen. If Llama's cursor hits an image, his cursor is locked in that spot for a few seconds. For every 1 dollar donated during the period of collecting 1 dollar donations, another ball will be added to the dodgeball game. The count starts around 10. evo_Demon gets a custom image which is massive and he can change the image at will.
- `Save & Quit` Forces Llama to save and quit immediately. This donation has a maximum usage of two times per area level per difficulty. This includes town levels. The price increases by $10 per difficulty. $59/$69/$79. Llama is flexible at times with mistimed save and quits or when two people donate them at the same time, and allows them to use it at a point later in the run.
- `Drop Stash` Forces Llama to drop every item in his stash.
- `Drop Equipped` Forces Llama to drop every item currently equipped.
	- With the above two options and the various drop item punishments, this means that Llama's inventory is completely safe from being targeted by item removal donations. However, this limits the amount of potions he can carry, forcing him to town more often.

### **Help Llama Options**
- These are the traitor options.
- `Guardian Angel` An overlay with background music that lasts for roughly 3 minutes. During this time, all punishments are delayed until the end of Guardian Angel. Save and Quits will not activate until after Guardian Angel ends. Llama can use skill points obtained from leveling up while Guardian Angel is active. Each time it is used, the price is increased by 5$. It is common to inflate the price early on.
- `Help Llama` Gives Llama an option to take half a duration from the maximum time of any punishment. He can reserve these. Two Help Llamas will remove 1 punishment entirely. Rules for this vary. Llama usually only ever uses these for Wheel punishments. Llama rarely, if ever, uses them for the Separate punishments.
- There are more options here that I am too lazy to currently figure out.

### **Time/Sum Options**
- `Shame Cap`
	- Shame Cap is a IRL Llama hat that looks like a Camel and an edited ingame item with negative stats. The Shame Cap takes away Run/Walk, Cast Rate, Vitality, All Resistances, and Light Radius. It gives Energy.
	- `Wear Shame Cap` From dollar donations, which includes subscriptions, Llama is forced to wear the Shame Cap for 10 minutes once the bar is filled. If the Shame Cap is already on, the timer is increased by 10 minutes.
	- `Upgrade Shame Cap` From bit donations, all stats present on the Shame Cap get increased once the bar is filled. More are added eventually.
- `Negative Split on Timer` If Llama gets a negative split on a timer (Red in color) in comparison to the previous MvS character run, Llama must do 20 situps and pushups.
- `Big Wheel` Every hour, the big wheel is rolled to change the prices of the Gear, Llama, and Game wheels. They will be randomly assigned $5, $8, and $12. There is one option which will set all three wheels to $5.

### **Unlisted Options**
- These options are usually triggered by Llama to avoid repetitive punishments or when specifically requested. They are not actively present in any wheels or individual options.
- `Big Spin` The Big Cursor but it spins in a 360 the entire time.
- `Scan Cursor` The cursor is duplicated all the way horizontally and all the way vertically. The vertical bar of cursors scrolls along horizontal bar of cursors, making the actual cursor placement confusing.
- `Shotgun Cursor` A random mess of cursors placed near the actual cursor. The position of these random cursors change very so often, so that Llama loses placement of the actual cursor.
- `RNGrid Cursor` Grid Cursor with roughly 33% of the cursors missing. Constantly randomizes which cursors are missing so that Llama loses position of the cursor.
- `[Name Unknown] Random Cursor` Cursor is changed periodically between existing cursor options. Unsure of which cursor options and how often.
- `Diablo 3` This overlay adds Diablo 3 elements to Diablo 2. The colors become extremely saturated. There is a pretty rainbow across the screen with Diablo 3 written in pretty font and colors. The main UI bar is changed to be more "user-friendly". Images of super cute things scroll across the screen. The background song is very happy, with a happy guitar and a happy person whistling happily. It is very cute and comforting.

### **Retired/No longer in use Options**
- `Adopt-a-Pixel` For every 2? dollar donation, chat could adopt 4 pixels. These pixels were randomly selected from the Diablo 2 window and permanently erased (made white) for the rest of MvS. There were a lot of complaints, especially by Llama as it got to the end because he could no longer see anything. LUL
- `Diablo 0` An overlay replicating old film visual quality, where the colors are black and white, grainy, and has bars moving across the screen with an old song as the background music. It was retired because of copyright claim abuse on the song that is used which is in the public domain.
